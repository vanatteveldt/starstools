# Stars! tools

Some simple python-based tools for stars.

I don't expect these to be directly useful for anyone, but if they are, good for you :)

Currently contains two tools:

+ [merge.py] Downloads and merges .m files of you and your ally and creates an html index with archive. 
  I run it in a cron job outputting to a password protected public html folder.
+ [fuel.py] Calculate fuel usage and booster requirements for a given trip, including slowing down and AR decay. 

Neither of them is meant to be generally useful and a lot of stuff is hard coded. 
So, if you want to use it you probably either need to adapt some things or make them more general. 
Pull requests welcome :)for your
